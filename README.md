## Project Description
---
 Planning and preparing your home emergency kit can be overwhelming. DisasterProof makes it easier by helping you think through what you will need, one category at a time. You can choose which option(s) seem like a good fit for you, and we will compile a custom checklist based on your selections. In just a few minutes, you will have made all the big decisions about your own disaster preparedness plan, and you can get started putting together your kit and making your household DisasterProof.

## Problem Domain:
---
Currently, no apps that we know of exist to help users create and manage a customized disaster preparedness checklist. There are many resources that tell users how to prepare for a disaster, but they often provide so much information that it's difficult to tell where to start. 

## User Stories:
---
### Feature: Customized List
"As a family of four living in Portland, I want to make sure that we are prepared for emergencies so that our family will be prepared! But I'm overwhelmed by all the resources that are available and don't know where to start." -User One

>DisasterProof makes planning easier by allowing individuals to answer just a few short questions and renders a customized list of tasks based entirely on what the user identifies as target goals. 

### Feature: Print/Save Rendered List
"As someone who wants to engage their whole household in planning, I want to be able to refer to this list repeatedly so that we can track our progress over time." - User Two

>DisasterProof allows each user to print and/or save their customized list. This will allow users to share their list with other household members, save it electronically, or print for a quick reference guide.

### Feature: At-a-Glance, Curated Tips
"As a Pacific Northwest newcomer, I am worried about 'the big one,' but I don't know much about earthquake safety. I want a quick overview that tells me what I need to know, just in case." - User Three
