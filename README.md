## Project Description

 Planning and preparing your home emergency kit can be overwhelming. DisasterProof makes it easier by helping you think through what you will need, one category at a time. You can choose which option(s) seem like a good fit for you, and we will compile a custom checklist based on your selections. In just a few minutes, you will have made all the big decisions about your own disaster preparedness plan, and you can get started putting together your kit and making your household DisasterProof.
