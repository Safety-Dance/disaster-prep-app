## Communications plan

### Group communications
* Use commmunications.md file in shared repo for communications among group plus the group Slack
* Emails will not be used for communication
* Group check ins at 11:45am (if needed) and 5:45pm

### Git
* Check in with team when ready to make a pull request
* No one works on the master branch
* No one merges their own PR. Ask a free group member to review. One reviewer is ok to approve merge. 
* First time we make a merge, everyone works together. 


## Conflict plan
* All group members are respected and every effort will be made to be collaborative in all areas of the project. 
* Group decisions will be made via majority rule, but all members perspective and ideas will be heard and listened to and the group will choose to move towards consensus whenever able
* Individual disagreements will be first worked out between the two party members and if needed,the group will be available to mediate/support.


## Breakout out tasks 
* User stories 
* Categories - mob program the first category together so that we can have a consistent format
