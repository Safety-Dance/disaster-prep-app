                    <p>Chelsea Spangler has chaired the Safety Committee of a local nonprofit and attended several Cascadia Quake preparedness trainings. In real life she constantly injures herself because she has terrible self-preservation instincts. She is irrationally terrified of earthquakes.</p>

                    <p>Joe Goodman has no background in safety related things and Cascadia Quake preparedness was literally the
                    last thing on his mind. See, Joe is a risk taker by nature and usually pushes things to the extreme. As
                    a result, Joe with a family of 4 is the perfect candidate to get value out of Disaster Proof. It just
                    may save some lives some day!!</p>

                    <p>Jenna Goldman is also terrified of earthquakes, and a big fan of checklists. She learned a lot while working on this project, and can’t wait to start checking off boxes on her own preparedness plan.</p>

                    <p>Scott once “popped” a can of Pringles and despite Kellog’s tenacious and composed insistence to the contrary, he was, indeed, able to stop. Whoa…
                    He does, however, keep a can or two stashed away for the aforementioned disaster type situ-aysh.</p>
