                Chelsea Spangler has chaired the Safety Committee of a local nonprofit and attended several Cascadia
                Quake preparedness trainings. In real life she constantly injures herself because she has terrible
                self-preservation instincts. She is irrationally terrified of earthquakes.

                <img src="../assets/devs/JOEG.jpg" alt="Joe" style="width:200px;height:200px">
                Joe Goodman has no background in safety related things and Cascadia Quake preparedness was literally the
                last thing on his mind. See, Joe is a risk taker by nature and usually pushes things to the extreme. As
                a result, Joe with a family of 4 is the perfect candidate to get value out of Disaster Proof. It just
                may save some lives some day!!

                Jenna Goldman is also terrified of earthquakes, and a big fan of checklists. She learned a lot while working on this project, and can’t wait to start checking off boxes on her own preparedness plan.

                Scott once “popped” a can of Pringles and despite Kellog’s tenacious and composed insistence to the contrary, he was, indeed, able to stop. Whoa…
                He does, however, keep a can or two stashed away for the aforementioned disaster type situ-aysh.

                When asked to recount an act of bravery in the face of danger, Janelle (she/her) responded, “going to Costco on a Sunday.”
